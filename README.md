This script has a few purposes;

- To help fix common typing mistakes I make & to autocorrect words I commonly misspell *(Ironically I just spelt that as `mispell`)*

- To autocomplete functions I use constantly throughout my scripts; `tool` functions, `block` functions, etc

- To autocomplete `#Include` sections with the appropriate classes with just a few characters

**note: `textreplace.ahk` is the only script that you need to run, the other scripts get `#Included` within `textreplace.ahk`*
