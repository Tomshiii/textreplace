> [!Warning]
> This script requires some `lib` files that are contained within a [separate repo](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/). You can check which files you need by looking at the top of each script and looking at any files contained within `<>`

This script has a few purposes;

- To help fix common typing mistakes I make & to autocorrect words I commonly misspell *(Ironically I just spelt that as `mispell`)*

- To autocomplete functions I use constantly throughout my scripts; `tool` functions, `block` functions, etc

- To autocomplete `#Include` sections with the appropriate classes with just a few characters

> [!Note]
> `textreplace.ahk` is the only script that you need to run, the other scripts get optionally `#Included` within `textreplace.ahk`
